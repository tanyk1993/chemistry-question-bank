"""Deliberate, recorded departures from the source document.

Handoff SS6D: "Consider recording what changed from the original so the bank does
not drift silently from the papers." That is the whole point of this file. A
correction applied here is applied ONCE, in one place, with a reason attached,
and the driver prints every hit. A correction made by hand in a SQL string is
invisible six months later.

Precedent: handoff SS4 item 8 corrected "as follow" -> "as follows" in RI's own
question paper. Schools' mark schemes contain ordinary human errors, and quietly
reproducing them into a revision tool is not fidelity, it is a bug with a
pedigree. But neither should they be changed without a trace.

Each entry is (pattern, replacement, reason, approved_by).
